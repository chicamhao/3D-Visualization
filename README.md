# Instruction:
  1. You need to create 3D objects first. 
  2. Click on that object's name shows on the blue box. 
  3. When your object has the orange outline, the features are yours. 
  4. Use camera: Arrow keys + 'Z' + 'X'. But first, you must 'Cancel' the current object.
  5. Believe me, you don't want to translate your objects with any number > 10.
